# Acoustics glider
A collection of tools to post-process and prepare datasets related to glider deployments with acoustics sensors on board (e.g. AZFP, DMON) for archiving at the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) and in Rutgers ERDDAP server.

AZFP (Acoustic Zooplankton Fish Profiler) glider datasets are QC'd and archived in NCEI's [Water Column Sonar Data](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/water-column-sonar-data) along with the raw AZFP data files and post-processed AZFP data.

DMON (WHOI Digital Acoustic Monitoring Instrument) glider datasets are QC'd and archived in NCEI's [Passive Acoustic Data Archive](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/passive-acoustic-data) along with the .wav audio files from the DMON
